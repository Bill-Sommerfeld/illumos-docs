## Introduction

The illumos community is small but active.  We welcome everybody who would like

of experience in systems software, or you're just getting started; whether you
work for a company that uses illumos, or you just find it personally
interesting.

We try to be helpful and inclusive!  It's not uncommon to see folks on both IRC
and the mailing lists discussing a range of issues, both simple and complex.
Whether you're just getting started, or you're debugging a difficult problem,
you should be able to find the help you need.
