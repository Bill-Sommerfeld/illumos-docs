# Getting Started

## Introduction

As illumos is the core of an operating system but not a distribution itself,
the easiest way to get started with illumos is to [download a
distro](../about/distro.md) and start playing.

## Manual pages

As with most Unix-like operating systems, illumos ships with an extensive
set of manual pages that describe how the system works.  You can view the
manual pages on an illumos system using the `man` command; e.g.,

```
$ man ls
```

You can also browse (and link to) the illumos manual pages [online](https://illumos.org/man); e.g., [ls(1)](https://illumos.org/man/1/ls).

## Books

We provide a number of [books](https://illumos.org/books) relating to illumos
technologies.  The books are open source, and can be edited in the
[illumos-docbooks](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-docbooks) repository.

If your goal is to work on illumos itself, the [Developer's
Guide](https://illumos.org/books/dev/) or the [Building
illumos](../developers/build.md) page are good places to get started.
